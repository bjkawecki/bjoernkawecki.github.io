Learning Russian is a real challenge. Thanks to the wide range of digital tools available today, foreign languages seem more accessible than ever. But which apps and platforms truly deliver on their promises—and which are actually suitable for self-study?

In the upcoming posts in this series, I will take a detailed look at individual apps and platforms and put them to the test—from features and usability to pricing. The focus will be on **interactive learning tools**, meaning apps and platforms that actively involve the user in the learning process.

Another requirement is that the offering must be aimed at a **German-speaking audience**. That is, the source language of the content must be German. An overview of the tools already reviewed can be found in the table below.
