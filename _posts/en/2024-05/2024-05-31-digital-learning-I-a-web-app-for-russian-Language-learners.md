title: "Digital Learning I: A Web App for Russian Language Learners"

In 2020, I began designing a web app intended to support Russian language learners. The idea arose from my own experience as a Slavic studies student. I always found it tedious to gather suitable learning materials for Russian.

Russian is rather exotic in Europe (like most languages except the Romance languages and English). Unlike English and French, there are practically no Russian loanwords in everyday German usage because Russia’s cultural influence has been much weaker.

So it’s no surprise that there are hardly any commercial offerings for Russian language learners. At least, I am not aware of any learning materials that cover the C1 language proficiency level.

It’s understandable that publishers don’t see much value in expanding their offerings purely for educational reasons (the situation is similar for other less common languages). In the age of affordable computers and free, open-source software, digital learning materials might actually be the better medium.

After all, the main disadvantage of a book (despite all its advantages) is that it can only present information in a linear fashion.
