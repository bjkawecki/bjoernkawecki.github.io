To conclude this introduction to my thoughts on the topic of “Digital Learning,” I’d like to summarize the key points:

1. Due to the extensive and cost-effective ability of computers to store, process, retrieve, and display data, **digital learning materials are superior to analog ones in certain cases**—particularly when it comes to delivering relatively simple, repetitive, or niche knowledge.

2. In the realm of educational software, **specialization is generally better than openness**. Anki is a prime example of an open system: it’s free, available on all platforms, but it doesn’t provide learning material suited to any particular domain.

   (One should remember, though, that nothing comes truly “free.” Even a free program like Anki requires development and maintenance.)

3. A specialized learning application must provide content created by **experts in the relevant domain**, optimally support the user’s learning process (through interactivity and multisensory design), offer **clear feedback on user input**, and still be available on **all major operating systems**.
