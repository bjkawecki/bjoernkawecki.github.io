<a class="inline-flex items-center" href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anki<svg class="dark:fill-fuchsia-500 fill-blue-500 h-[1.1em] w-auto ml-0.5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><title>anki-webpage</title><path d="M14,3V5H17.59L7.76,14.83L9.17,16.24L19,6.41V10H21V3M19,19H5V5H12V3H5C3.89,3 3,3.9 3,5V19A2,2 0 0,0 5,21H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,19V12H19V19Z" /></svg></a> is a prime example of a highly flexible learning tool. It’s not only suitable for learning Russian, but for virtually any learning goal that involves memorizing a large amount of information efficiently. This has both advantages and disadvantages.

The app is based on the principle of **spaced repetition**, meaning systematic repetition at increasing intervals—a method that is particularly effective for training long-term memory.

## What speaks in favor of Anki?

- **Free of charge**: Anki is open source and free on almost all platforms—Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, or via the web. Only the iOS app costs a one-time fee of €29.99.

- **Cross-platform**: Syncing between smartphone, tablet, and desktop works smoothly.

- **Customizable**: Nearly everything can be tailored—from card layout to review intervals to plugins.

- **Feature-rich**: Audio support, keyboard input, images, cloze deletions.

- **Community and Add-ons**: An active user community provides extensions that can further expand the app’s capabilities.

## Where are the weaknesses?

- **Steep learning curve**: Creating your own cards takes time and effort—especially when trying to build meaningful content in German for Russian. This is particularly difficult for beginners without prior knowledge.

- **No built-in didactic concept**: Anki provides a tool but no structured learning system. Without a strategy, it’s hard to make meaningful progress.

- **Quality varies**: While shared decks from other users are available, their quality can vary greatly and is often hard to assess.

- **Limited learning mode**: The app focuses exclusively on flashcards. Interactive elements beyond simple recall are not part of the concept.

- **No objective feedback**: While progress is tracked statistically, there is no external assessment of your level (e.g., a CEFR evaluation).

## Conclusion

Anki is a powerful learning platform for those willing to invest time and structure into their self-study. It can also be a valuable tool for language learners.

However, for beginners and self-taught learners without prior knowledge or study routines, the app may be too open-ended and technical.
